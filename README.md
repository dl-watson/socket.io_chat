# socket.io_chat

A real-time chat application created with Socket.io, Express, Node.js, Pug, and PostgresQL. 

Deployed backend: https://dry-plateau-89749.herokuapp.com/chat

### Next steps:
* Add a landing page with a user login (so that the login can be used as the username rather than needing to hard-code this data)
    * will involve setting up a user class instance
* clear all chats feature
    * add a delete all method to the Messages model
    * add a clear all handler to the frontend
